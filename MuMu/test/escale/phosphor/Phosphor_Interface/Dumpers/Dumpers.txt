# The PHOSPHOR dumper scripts reads the saved ROOT files from the PHOSPHOR Fits
# and grabs the results of the scale and resolution values as snippets of code
# for the PhosphorCorrectorFunctor

# JanFitExp_phosphorDumper.py was the original dumper

# phosphor_dumper.py and corrector_cpena.py were updated for the 2012 PHOSPHOR analysis 
# to create the original .txt files for the PhosphorCorrectorFunctor

# Modified_phosphorDumper.py expanded to focus on the 2012 data with more pt bins and bins 
# of high and low pile up. The output is not used by the PhosphorCorrectorFunctor but can run
# through ProcessValues.py to produce LaTeX tables to display the resolution and scale values

# PhosphorDumper_2013.py is the updated version of the phosphor_dumper.py for the 2013-2014 analysis
# with more pt bins for the PhosphorCorrectorFunctor
