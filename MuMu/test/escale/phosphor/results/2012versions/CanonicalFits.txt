# We extract the constant, stochastic, and noise components of the energy resolution 
# by fitting the relationship between the resolution and pt.

# For each analysis on must first determine the centers of each pt bin using et_bins.py in the results directory.
# These are added to regression_restrue.py, regression_resdata.py and regression_resmc.py in order to plot the 
# resolution against pt with correct error bars.

# Run regression_restrue.py, regression_resmc.py and regression_resdata.py in that order to plot the relationship
# between resolution and pt. The results we be saved in ROOT files which are read by MCTruthRes_Pt.py, MCRes_Pt.py
# and DataRes_Pt.py to fit the plots and extract the resolution contributions. 

# frp_sixie_valere.py plots the energy scale against pt
