TODO
----
o Soft photons
o Propagate errors on E(ecal) vs E(muons) (done, need to do UBML to properly weighted E(gamma)/E(mu)
o Do full monte carlo study
o Understand the contributions of inner and outer brems
  - check sim candidates in MC (is outer brem more often at deta/dphi < 1
o Muon foot print
  - muon energy deposition spectra in ECAL and HCAL
  - check Ashok's paper
  - see how MC performs
  - Does muon cross any crystals that are connected to the clusters of the photon?
o Pt(near mu) / Pt(gamma)
o Photon timing
o Other photon flags
o Eta(gamma) assymmetry in observed candidates
o Muon kinematics
o Show actual values of Delta R
o Apply photon ID
  - check idea with Neyman-Pearson of the eta-profile
  - understand sigmaIetaIeta: Why is the weight computed the way it is?
  - Where does the max (4.7, -log(E_i/E) come from? (Sam Harper?)
o J/psi's
o Y's
